“Aakash for Blind & Special Children”
Aakash and  Prakaash which means sky and light gave me an idea about vision of blind, we have observed a problem of routine nature is that we all commute, on a day to day basis and  if we are asked to travel with a blind fold on your eyes it would be very hard to walk even keeping aside commute on some bus, so I feel like the idea of using a computing device in service of blind people who blind but alive as they have to  carry out life process on a day to day basis, it would be a voice driven GPS which acts as guidance during commute and a currency identifier.
We also think for special children, which have dyslexia/autism or have difficulty learning, we can design a gesture learning system, which can give an instant feedback which can help them learn with proper motivation, we can design a system for education, like for learning alphabets we can ask the child to draw a particular alphabet using gestures, on match a feedback would be given so that he can learn unattended and give necessary confidence required for education. The way we used connects dots to create shapes, alphabets and numbers.
The system will also have an object displaying / object recognition software module where aakash will show an object play a recorded sound and ask the child to reproduce the sound like for example it will ask children this is apple and will ask what it is called, on the child saying the name of the object like apple back will again provide a confidence building audio/ sound “great Job/ kya baat hai badiya, ” which will augment their leaning in spite having disability.
The target group of the application would be Blind students/people and special Children mostly primary education

Section 2
Rationale

Aakash is a nice thought, combining cloud computing with tablet computing,
it is very much an affordable device to the level of student can buy aakash 
as his computing device, for an array of purposes, which includes highly 
interactive learning these include 3D Modelling, C++ programming, remote
and collaborative training applications, robotic control and live assessment
tools. 

Device Specs: Aakash 2 runs on Android 4.0 ‘Ice Cream Sandwich’ and features a
7inch multi-touch capacitive display with a resolution of 800*480. Other specs
include a 1GHz Cortex A8 processor, 512MB RAM, 4GB internal flash memory 
and connectivity options like micro USB and micro-SD slot with support
up to 32GB memory cards which means the possibilities are endless and the
computational power is at par with other tablet devices.


So we think that, it has all the makings which may be required for the device
to succeed in any area of application be it education, and our proposal also 
can be implemented using an android SDK and some programing skill for patter 
recognition algorithms and image processing algorithms.

Feasibility analysis revealed that the said proposal is highly feasible in terms of:

•  Economic feasibility: All the software and hardware required is either of very low 
cost or is open source so the proposal has high economic feasibility and rewards achieved 
are both economic and social.

•	Technical feasibility: The said proposal under consideration is highly technically
feasible as the software required is open source and the algorithms required for the
image / pattern recognition are already existing and very efficient. The android SDK 
is open source and free of cost.

•	Social feasibility: The proposal if implemented will help a section of society 
which is yet untapped and will lead to the realization of the potential of the 
said target group of the proposal.

Section 3
Plan
=====
Our software would have two major modules:

•	MODULE FOR BLIND(MFB)
•	MODULE FOR DYSLEXIA AND SPECIAL CHILDREN(MFDSC)


In the first module the plan is to develop the application for android device like android ICS/ Jelly Bean
and will use the Andriod SDKs GPS API(application programing interface) and help using voice related
API of SDK for voice commands to the GPS and guiding audio like turn right , left 10 meters ahead etc.

In the module we would develop a module for currency identification, as identification of the notes
will be done on pattern on the corner and the color of the note as in Indian currency we have about nine 
notes (one, two, five, ten, twenty, fifty, hundred, five hundred, thousand note)

The notes in Indian currency can be differentiated on various parameters few of the being pattern 
dependent and color dependent.

In the second module MFDSC we would design the app for android device like aakash using SDK  for pattern
matching  of already stored patterns of alphabets and store audio feedback for various actions the children 
will make for their confidence boosting.
We  will also use voice recognition algorithms for recognize the feedback of the children  as recognition
of the objects
